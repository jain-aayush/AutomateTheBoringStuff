## Completed Practice Projects from the book - Automate The Boring Stuff

The following repository is a collection of Practice Problems given in Automate The Boring Stuff.


The problems are marked according to their chapter numbers and the question is stated in the solution file.









Since I already had covered the basics of Python prior to reading this book, the problems that I practice are from Chapter 7 and not from the very beginning.
